    <blockquote>
      <p>For example: if one compares 1H and 2H weapon with the same damage per hit and the same critical hit chance, 1H weapon would generally have higher DPS, but 2H weapons have on the other hand longer reach. In such situation, the choice of weapon should depend on personal preference of the player and type and attack pattern of the target.</p>
      <p>From my personal experiences with the games (especially Gothic 2), I found having a weapon with longer reach (2H) to be much more useful than having a weapon with faster attack speed (1H). It depends on what fighting style you use, but even though 2H weapons attack slower, this slower attack speed has just the right 'tempo' to constantly interrupt almost all interruptible enemies.</p>
      <p>Fighting blockable humanoids using block-hit or block-block-hit (for enemies with higher weapon skill) fighting style, one would only benefit from having higher attack speed:</p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>by being able to use block-hit-hit instead of block-hit or block-hit-block-hit(-hit) instead of block-block-hit without getting hit in the process,</li>
        <li>when the 2H weapon is really slow (weapon skill &lt; 30%) and you cannot avoid getting hit during either block-hit or block-block-hit,</li>
        <li>when you can successfully pin the enemy against the wall (higher DPS of 1H weapon would be more befeficial in this situation, especially useful against zombies 1v1).</li>
      </ol>

      <li>There is only an option to choose Gothic 1 or Gothic 2, because both Gothic 2 vanilla and Gothic 2 with expansion  Night of the Raven (also sold as Gothic 2 Gold Edition) use the same formulas to calculate damage.</li>
      <li>There is an option to use the Claw of Beliar with either game selected and with any weapon type, even though it was available only in Gothic 2 NotR as 1H or 2H weapon. Weapon damage, lightning damage and lightning hit chance are fully adjustable, but the adjustments you make might not reflect the Claw of Beliar as seen in the game.</li>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The Claw of Beliar (TCOB) (the version seen in game) is either 1H or 2H sword (based on your higher weapon skill), that has 20 levels. You gain 1 level at the shrine of Beliar in exchange for 5 hitpoints (permanently). That means, that fully upgraded TCOB will cost you 100 HP.</p>
      <p>The level of TCOB is tied to Nameless Hero's level (NHL). Upgrading at NHL 1&ndash;10 will give you TCOB level 1. NHL 11 will give you TCOB level 2, and so on. You will be able to upgrade TCOB every 2 NHL. To get the highest level TCOB (level 20), you will need NHL 47.</p>
      <p>The stats of TCOB (1H weapon damage / 2H weapon damage / lightning hit chance) are 90/100/12 at level 1 and 110/120/50 at level 20 (damage is increased by 1 and lightning hit chance by 2 per one level of TCOB).</p>
